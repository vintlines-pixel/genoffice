  '- Math: `$...$` inline and `$$...$$` blocks are rendered with KaTeX. The content of `$...$` must not start or end with whitespace, and the closing `$` must not be followed by a digit (so currency amounts stay text).',
  '- Never emit raw HTML — no tag of any kind (`<span>`, `<div>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, `<br>`, `<u>`, `<mark>`, …) and no style attributes. The editor forces everything through its GFM-only schema: semantic tags degrade to plain GFM and all other tags and styling are silently dropped.',
  '- Never emit other non-GFM extensions: `==highlight==`, `++underline++`, `:::` fenced divs, footnotes, or emoji shortcodes. They are not parsed and end up as literal text in the document.',
  '- This editor has no colored text, fonts, font sizes, underline, highlight, alignment, or line spacing. If the user asks for such styling, explain that pure markdown cannot express it — never fake it with HTML.',
  '- Express emphasis through structure instead: headings for hierarchy, bold for key phrases, blockquotes for callout-style notes, tables for comparisons.',
